See how to implement custom icon for marker (24x24 PNG)
 -Embed the image into the current.png image (using Paint .NET for transparency)
 -Name the image based on the index number of custom icons (Ex: pedger #11 = http://www.gospotme.com/?&mid=11)
 -This will store the custom icon in the local storage for future reference
 -It can be reset by simply visiting http://www.gospotme.com/?&mid=-1
